EduZynora was initiated as a student-built platform to organize and provide educational materials such as notes, PDFs, and sample papers.

## Current Scope
This repository currently contains the initial project setup and concept files.  
The core application structure and full resource management features are not yet implemented.

## Tech Stack (Intended)
- Python / Django (expected)
- HTML • CSS • JavaScript  
*(Actual implemented code may be minimal at this stage)*

## Status
Paused — planned for future iteration.

Development is currently paused while focus is placed on other higher-priority systems.

If revisited, this repo will evolve into a structured web platform for educational resources.
